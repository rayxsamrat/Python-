        "Q 1     What is Python,and why is it popular ?   \n",
        "        -  Python is an interpreted,object-oriented,high level programming language developed by ''GUIDO VAN ROSSUM'' in the year 1991 at CWI in Neitherland.It is known for its clear syntax and readability,which makes it relatively easy to use.\n",
        "    Python popularity is due to a combination of factors:\n",
        "          1. Beginner-Friendly\n",
        "          2. Versatile\n",
        "          3. Large and active community\n",
        "          4. Extensive libraries\n",
        "          5.    \n",
        "Q.2     What is an Interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "         -  In Python,the interpreter is a program that reads and execute Python code line by line.It acts as an intermediary between code and the computer hardware traslating our instructions into machine-readable language\n",
        "Q.3     What are pre-defined keywords in   \n",
        "        Python ?\n",
        "         - In Python,pre-defined keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and purpose and cannot be used as veriables names,functions name,or any other identifiers.\n",
        "        EX---True,None,and,if etc.\n",
        "Q.4     Can Keywords used as variable names ?\n",
        "         - Since keywords are reserved and pre-defined,so cannot used as variable names.\n",
        "Q.5    What is Mutability in Python ?\n",
        "        - In Python,Mutablity refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it is created.If an object can be modified after creation,it is considered mutable.\n",
        "       EX-- Lists,Sets,Dictionaries etc\n",
        "Q.6      Why are lists Mutable,but tuples are\n",
        "        immutables?\n",
        "         - if an object can be modified after creation,considered as Mutable.In this way,List are implemented as dynamic arrays i.s can grow or shrink as needed.Whereas tuples are immutables because tuples are impemented as fixed-size arrays,which means their size and content are determined when they are created\n",

        "Q.7      What is the difference between “==”  \n",
        "          and “is”operators in Pyhton ?\n",
        "          - \"==\" refers to as an equality operator that compares the values of two objects.\n",
        "        It returns True if the values of the operands are equal,otherwise False.\n",
        "        ex-a = [1,2,3]\n",
        "           b=a\n",

        "           print(a==c) # True\n",
        "         \"is\" refers to as an identity operator that compares the memory address of two object.It returns True if both operands refer to the same object in the memory,otherwise False.\n",
        "         ex- a = [1,2,3]\n",
        "             b=a\n",

        "Q.8     What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "         -Logical operators are used to combine or modify Boolean expressions.there are three main logical operators in Python:\n",
        "       i.and-Returns True if both operands are true.Ex- x=5 and y=10\n",
        "       print(x < 5 and y > 5) # Output:True\n",
        "       ii.or-Returns True if at least one operands is True,otherwise False.\n",
        "       Ex- x=5 0r y=10\n",
        "        print(x > 10 or y > 5)  # Output:True\n",
        "       iii.not-Returns the opposite Boolean value of the operand.If the operand is true,it returns False,and if operand is False,it returns true.\n",
        "       Ex- x=5\n",
        "           print(not x > 10) # Output:True\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9     What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "         -Type casting,also known as type conversion,is the processs of changing the data type of a variable from one type to another like converting an integer to a string or a float to an integer.Exception-cannot convert a string containing letters to an integer.\n",
        "       Ex- x=10 #integer\n",
        "           y=\"20\" #string\n",
        "           # Convert y to an integer\n",
        "            z= int(y)  \n",
        "       # Now  perform addition\n",
        "         result = x + z  \n",
        "         print(result) # Output: 30\n",
        "Q.10   What is the difference between implicit\n",
        "      and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "        - Type casting is nothing but converting one data type to another data type.It is of two type\n",
        "            i. Implicit Type Casting :-It is also known as automatic type conversion.It is performed by the Python interpreter automatically,without any user intervention.\n",
        "        Ex - x = 10  # integer\n",
        "             y = 3.14  # float\n",
        "\n",
        "       result = x + y  # implicit type casting: x is converted to float before addition\n",
        "\n",
        "      print(result)  # Output: 13.14 (float)\n",
        "\n",
        "            ii. Explicit Type Cating:-It is also known as type coercion,Pperformed by the programmer using built in type conversion functions like int(),float(),str(),etc\n",
        "            Ex- x = 10.5  # float\n",
        "       y = int(x)  # explicit type casting: x is converted to integer\n",
        "       print(y)  # Output: 10 (integer)\n",
        "Q.11  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "       -Conditionals in Python are used to execute code based on the evaluation of one or more conditions.\n",
        "      The purpose of conditional statements in Python are to control the flow of execution.\n",
        "Q.12  How does the elif statement worK?\n",
        "       -The elif statement is a conditional statement that stand for \"else if.\"It is used in an 'if' statement to check multiple contions sequentially.\n",
        "      EX- score = 69\n",
        "          if score >=90\n",
        "             grade =\"A\"\n",

        "       print(\"Your grade is:\",grade)  # Output:Your grade is: D          \n",
        "Q.13  What is the difference between for and\n",
        "      while loops?\n",
        "      - The basic difference is :-  \"for\"loops are used for iterating over a sequence of elements(like a list,tuple,string,or range),while \"while\"loops are used for repeatedly executing a block of code as long as a condition is True.\n",
        "Q.14   Describe a scenario where a while loop  \n",
        "       is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "       -Scenario:\n",
        "          You want to keep asking the user for input until they enter a valid email address. You don't know how many times you'll need to ask.\n",
        "        Reasoning:\n",
        "       . Unknown Number of Iterations: In this scenario, you don't know beforehand how many times the loop will need to run. The user might enter an invalid email multiple times before providing a valid one. While loops are ideal for situations where the number of iterations is uncertain.\n",
        "      . Condition-Based Execution: While loops continue executing as long as a specific condition is True. In this case, the loop would continue as long as the user's input is not a valid email.  \n"
